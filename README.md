# MBTI-Personality-Types-EDA

For my data analysis project, I chose to analyze personality data. I’m interested in the field of psychology and wanted to work on psychological data. I also love personality tests and love predicting people’s personalities. This project was something that tied both my areas of interest- people and data.

Primary Questions
I looked at the relationship between various demographic variables and whether they are correlated to a person’s MBTI personality type. There are 16 personality types that are formed by a combination of 4 factors.

Introversion (I) vs Extroversion (E)
Intuitive (N) vs Sensing (S)
Thinking (T) vs Feeling (F)
Judging (J) vs Prospecting (P)
The 16 personality types include:

INTJ (Architect)
INTP (Logician)
ENTJ (Commander)
ENTP (Debater)
INFJ (Advocate)
INFP (Mediator)
ENFJ (Protagonist)
ENFP (Campaigner)
ISTJ (Logistician)
ISFJ (Defender)
ESTJ (Executive)
ESFJ (Consul)
ISTP (Virtuoso)
ISFP (Adventurer)
ESTP (Entrepreneur)
ESFP (Entertainer)
I also individually analyzed each component of the personality type to look at any individual trends.

Some of the questions I looked at were as follows:

What is the relationship between Age, Gender, Education, and Personality traits?
Are there personality types that are more common than the others?
How are different personality traits (Introversion, Thinking, etc.) split across populations?
